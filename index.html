                    <h2>Skyrim</h2>
                    <p>
                        Taking its players into the cold, northern of the fantasy world of Tamriel, Skyrim has been a massive success for game makers Bethesda. You take the role of the Dragonborn, and almost from the beginning, you already have to much to do. You can head straight to fulfilling your destiny and save the realm...or you can bugger off and join a Fighter's Guild made up of werewolves or a Mage's College. With a variety of play styles, and having been ported to most game systems of the last decade, there is always an adventure awaiting you on your return to Skyrim.

                    <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>
                    <p>Blizzard Entertainment brought the World of Warcraft online in 2004, taking players to Azeroth &#8209; the setting of Blizzard's successful real time strategy games &#8209; and took the world by storm. This massively successful MMORPG is full of things to do, with multiple class and faction storylines, dungeons to delve, and epic raid bosses that will take coordination to take down. You can even show your faction pride by participating in player vs player battlegrounds. With consistent expansions and updates, the World of Warcraft constantly beckons its players back. </p>

                    <h2>Monster Hunter: World</h2>
                    <p>Capcom's Monster Hunter series has been popular for a long time, but that is an understatement for their newest addition to the series. Since its release in early 2018, it has quickly become Capcom's highest selling game, and its hard to not see why. Monster Hunter: World lets you take on an entire continent worth of giant monsters, from the T-Rex like Anjanath to the crafty Kulu-Ya-Ku and the graceful ice drake Legiana, with a wide range of weapons. Each hunt is an epic battle, and with a rewarding item crafting system, you'll find your hours flying by as you engage on the hunt.</p>

                    <h2>Overwatch</h2>
                    <p>This popular first person shooter from Blizzard Entertainment is a joy to play. A hero based shooter, you can embody a number of different heroes, each with their own unique personality and game style. Either push the payload, take the point, or go on a kill streak with five other teammates on a variety of colorful and stylish maps. Can you get the Play of the Game?</p>

                    <h2>Darksouls 3</h2>
                    <p>The most recent in FromSoftware's line of punishing games, Dark Souls 3 may be one of the most rewarding game experiences &#8209; if the frustration of dying to the same enemy for the fifteenth time doesn't drive you insane. Be precise in your swings, for each enemy proves to be more than capable of sending your broken Unkindled body back to the bonfire. The world is beautifully dark, the story &#8209; however cryptic it may be &#8209; takes you across many kingdoms and time eras and introduces you to a host of memorable characters. Be prepared to die...again and again and again, but love every moment of it.</p>
